                        The Old Gods of Asgard were founded in 1971 by the Anderson Brothers. 
                        In the process of forming the band, the brothers decided to co-opt the identities of norse gods Odin and Tor.
                        Later the Anderson brothers were joined by &quot;Fat&quot; Bob Balder and Loki Darkens, the band started gaining momentum during their first year of playing.
                        In 1972, bandmate Loki&#8212;who was often at odds with the rest of the Old Gods&#8212;went missing, though the band decided to continue on without him
                        with just the three memebers, Odin, Tor, and Balder.
                        The band continued on for a decade in relative popularity until Balder passed away. 
                        The Anderson Brothers later retired and settled down in Bright Falls, Washington.

                        Odin Anderson was the groups centerman and primary songwriter. He was the one who originally came up with 
                        the idea of the Old Gods persona, 
                        and was often responsible for keeping the band organized and stable. 
                        Unlike the rest of the band, he was often comfortable in the spotlight, preferring impecable technique to flamboyant displays.

                        Taking the person of Tor, the tempestuous God of Thunder, Tor Anderson broght a lot of charisma and energy to the band.
                        Often seen as the band's frontman and most recognizable member, he had the biggest physical presence in the band, often being as quick to laugh as to anger.

                        Fat Bob Balder was known for his friendly demeanor. 
                        He was often reguarded as the glue that held the band together, smoothing things over with Loki before his disappearance, 
                        and maintaining a calming presence that countered Tor's volatile one.
                        The Old Gods of Asgard fell apart after his death to leukemia in 1980.
